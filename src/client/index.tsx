/**
 * Browser half: WorkBuddy XD Pool health and model directory, mounted as its
 * own page in the Settings panel's left nav.
 *
 * Registration shape (see the NOTE below — the choice of slot and of injected
 * services is what decides whether this half loads at all):
 *
 *  - `inject` names ONLY services that exist on BOTH host lines. Cordis' gate
 *    is hard: an inject entry the running line does not provide keeps `apply`
 *    from ever running, and the entry stays PENDING forever, so the Desktop
 *    reports "renderer boot failed (plugins: dsh-workbuddy-xdpool)" and refuses
 *    to open. `settingsScope` (0.1.5) and `configForms` (0.1.7) are mutually
 *    exclusive names for the same idea, so neither may be named here; whichever
 *    exists is reached through `ctx.get()` inside `apply`.
 *  - The page registers into `settings.section`, which BOTH lines declare and
 *    which is what puts a row in the Settings panel's left nav — the same slot
 *    the built-in General/Models/Plugins pages use. The old
 *    `settings.plugin.item` seat this plugin used is 0.1.5-only: it does not
 *    exist on 0.1.7 at all, so registering there silently showed no card.
 *
 * The whole body stays inside try/catch so a slot-API change degrades to a
 * console.error instead of tripping the host's "Failed to load plugins" banner.
